StrechIt is a Chrome Extension designed to help users that do long computer seesions correct their posture and prevent back and carpal tunnel pain. 

## Goal
Our goal with this project is to help prevent back and carpall tunnel pain, which was greatly incresead by the pandemic need to study/work at home. We achieved this by creating StrechIt, a Chrome Extension that can remind and teach users how to be healthier during long computer seesions. 

## User Experience
After installing the extension the user is prompted to a welcome page, where they have the option to configure their settings. There there will be sliders where the user can configure how often, what type, and how their reminders should be recieved. The program than runs on the background, whith the capabilities of reminding users to take a break, do a strech routine (with ilustrative animation) or correct their posture.
