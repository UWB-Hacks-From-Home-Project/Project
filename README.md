### Contributions
Created by Audrey, Alex, Vincent, Pedro and Christian

### User Experience
after the user has been doing work for a while, they get a notification reminding them to take a break or fix their posture or to do a stretch.
using the amount they were typing/ mouse usage/ browser usage can make notifications pop up faster.(this can be turned off in options)
if a notification of a stetch pops up there will be a gif as well as instructions showing how to do it
